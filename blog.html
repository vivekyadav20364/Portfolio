                    <h2>Learn Developing- In Fun Way!</h2>
                    <p>An interesting truth that arose from LeadDev is that, in the engineering world, change isn't
                        novel, it's constant. A quote by Sarah Hendron cited by David captured this idea: “What's
                        powerful about engineering is an understanding that the built world isn't permanent.”
                        Technologists are capable of handling change, and the way to adapt your organization is through
                        agile, data-backed decision-making that lifts up your team, improves communication and installs
                        a culture of collaboration.

                        Neha Batra, Senior Director of Engineering at GitHub, spoke passionately about how communication
                        needs to be the central focus for engineering leadership. Focusing on communication drives a
                        healthy, transparent culture. This transparency is vital in optimizing delivery lead times.
                        Transparency comes in many forms, whether it's simply leadership admitting where they made
                        mistakes in a stand-up or using engineering insights platforms like Pluralsight Flow to better
                        understand, and report on, the health of overall workflow and the team at large.</p>

                    <h2>Learning Javascript - The Scripting Language</h2>
                    <p>Theory is boring. Practice makes perfect. And fun practices own the game.
                        In order to have sustained interest while learning JavaScript, I often tend to make my work as
                        fun as possible.
                        With the help of Console Tab and a little creativity, you can make learning JavaScript more
                        interesting than ever.
                        Do you still want to have fun with JavaScript? Keep reading.<br>
                        Make a Mess of a Web Page
                        No one likes messy things. In fact, I really hate it because it takes me time in a lot of
                        things. But that doesn't mean I always make everything perfect. Sometimes a little mess can make
                        my day. More important, it's fun.

                        When you look at a perfect website, you might be interested. But if you break that perfection
                        you might feel more excited. Trust me.

                        OK, let's break the perfection of a website anyway.

                        So, who are our first victims? Let's pick WikiHow.

                        First, look at the source code of wikihow to see what tags are being used.
                        <br>
                        As you can see, there are many tags: div, li, ul, p, span, img, etc.

                        Now, we paste the following code into the Console Tab:

                    <h2>Learn CSS</h2>
                    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Where HTML is what defines the structure and content of a
                        web page, a Cascading Style Sheet is a web document that allows you to change the appearance of
                        the HTML.

                        CSS allows you to change the size, style, font, and color of text; margins and padding;
                        background colors and border styles. It can also be used to position elements on a page (but
                        we'll leave that for another day)<br>
                        The best thing about CSS is that is allows you to make global style changes that affect every
                        instance of a certain element throughout your blog or website so that you don't have to make
                        these changes at the individual page level. This saves you a ton of time when it comes to
                        redesigning your blog.

                        Here’s an example of what I mean: as we learned last week, the page title on a blog page is
                        defined by an HTML element called an H1 (heading 1). By default, the browser displays an H1 as
                        extra large, bold, black text, much like we saw in the PAWS example.

                        If we want to change the color, font and size of all the H1's on our blog to keep consistency
                        throughout, all you need to do is define what all H1's will look like in your CSS.

                        Sometimes different browsers may display slightly different default styles. Using a style sheet
                        to define what a specific element should look like can keep the look of your blog consistent
                        from one browser to another as well as one device to another.</p>

                    <h2>Learn HTML-In fun Way!</h2>
                    <p>What is HTML?
                        Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if
                        you know what you are writing.

                        HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make
                        them functional.

                        The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a
                        later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.

                        The History of HTML
                        HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It
                        stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

                        Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places
                        in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.

                        A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed
                        and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
